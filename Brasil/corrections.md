Firstly, I would like to congratulate the authors for their work. I only suggest a few changes to improve it:

1) Mention the software used to develop the work;

2) Clarify whether you are going to develop software for 3D visualization. It is not clear whether Figure 1 represents the software you developed;

3) As the word "tumor" is already in the title of the work, I suggest changing it in keywords;

4) If possible, add some reference to second and third paragraph of the introduction;

5) Correct some typos present in the text;
6) Cite Figure 1 in the text;
7) Put all references in the same format. Reference 5 has the authors' names in capital letters;
8) Check reference 7, the title of the thesis is missing.
